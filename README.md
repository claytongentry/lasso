# Lasso

Lasso lets you spin up a local web server to assert on your application's HTTP interactions with remote services.

Inspired by [Bypass](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/bypass) and built on top of the great work on [Bandit](https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit) by Mat Trudel.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lasso, "~> 0.1.0-pre"}
